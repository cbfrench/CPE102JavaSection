1) To plant a large tree in the ground, press the "T" key first to bring up the tree's image over your mouse's position. This tree will turn red if 
   the pointer is over an obstacle, and if it's not, it can be placed with the click of the mouse.
2) This newly planted tree becomes an obstacle in the world, meaning the miners cannot pass through it. In addition to that, the tree acts as a spawn
   point for our newly created fairies.
3) This new class of fairies only affects the OreBlob entities.
4) The fairies hunt down OreBlobs and once they catch up with them, they turn the blobs into crystals, which then turn into veins after a short time.
